# ImageClassification
The dataset for training and testing the model is from [FashionAI Attributes Recognition of Apparel Dataset](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/136948). The dataset can be downloaded directly from the link as long as youâ€™ve registered for a free account.<br>
<br>
There are two training datasets designed for round 1 and round 2 of the competition. Since the categories and labels are the same, I combined the images in these two datasets together as a new dataset. The training job is done baded on the integrated dataset.
<br>
AttributeDescription.md displays the information about the attributes contained in the dataset.
